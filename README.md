What if a project that counted for just 10% of a classwork sheet could make a real-world impact?

During my time as a video editor in high school, I met many talented individuals with visual impairments who struggled with color-based tasks in creative fields like video editing and graphic design. That experience stayed with me.

So, me and my team took our college project to another level. We built an image caption generator that uses grayscale images to improve accessibility for people with color blindness. By leveraging NLP technologies and deep learning, we implemented 4 algorithms to generate English captions for images, and a 5th algorithm to translate them into Arabic. This allowed us to create a more inclusive experience for those working in visually-driven industries.

By aligning our project with SDG 10: Reduced Inequality, we aim to make visual content more accessible, helping creative professionals navigate their work without barriers posed by color vision impairment.

Letâ€™s keep using tech to create equal opportunities for all.
